## Core Content

### Fixed Income Role in Wealth Management

| Client Need | Fixed Income Solution | Typical Allocation |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Capital preservation | Short-duration Treasuries, agency MBS | 20-40% |
| Income generation | Corporate bonds, munis, preferreds | 15-30% |
| Portfolio diversification | Multi-sector bond exposure | 10-25% |
| Liability matching | Duration-matched bonds | Varies by situation |
| Tax efficiency | Municipal bonds, tax-advantaged structures | HNW: 20-50% of FI allocation |
| Inflation protection | TIPS, floating-rate notes | 5-15% |
| Growth | High-yield bonds, EM debt, convertible bonds | 5-15% |

### Client Segmentation and Bond Strategies

**Mass Affluent ($250k-$1M)**:
- Primarily bond funds/ETFs (efficient access, diversification)
- Limited direct bond holdings (typically Treasuries via brokerage)
- Focus: simplicity, low cost, tax efficiency

**High Net Worth ($1M-$30M)**:
- Mix of direct bonds and funds/ETFs
- Customized municipal bond ladders
- Individual corporate bonds held to maturity
- Separate managed accounts (SMAs) with bond managers
- Structured notes for tailored risk/return

**Ultra High Net Worth ($30M+)**:
- Direct bond portfolios with dedicated managers
- Private placements (Rule 144A bonds)
- Bespoke structured products
- Family office manages bond allocation in-house
- Direct participation in bond syndications
- Collateralized lending against bond portfolios

Question: Why do UHNW clients hold bonds directly instead of funds? Answer: Control over maturity (avoid forced selling), tax-loss harvesting at individual bond level, customization of cash flows, and no management fees.

### Tax-Aware Bond Investing

| Bond Type | Federal Tax | State/Local Tax | Best Account Location |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Treasuries | Taxable | Exempt state/local | Taxable account |
| Agency bonds | Taxable | Taxable | Tax-deferred (IRA) |
| Municipal bonds (in-state) | Tax-exempt | Tax-exempt | Taxable account |
| Municipal bonds (out-of-state) | Tax-exempt | Taxable in-state | Taxable account |
| Corporate bonds | Taxable | Taxable | Tax-deferred (IRA) |
| TIPS | Taxable (phantom income) | Exempt state/local | Tax-deferred if possible |
| High-yield bonds | Taxable | Taxable | Tax-deferred (IRA) |

**Tax-equivalent yield**:
```text
TEY = Municipal Yield / (1 - Federal Tax Rate - State Tax Rate)
```

**Tax-loss harvesting**: Sell bonds at loss to offset gains, replace with similar (not substantially identical) bonds
- Must avoid wash sale rule (30-day window)
- More opportunities in volatile bond markets
- Municipal bond swaps common for tax-loss harvesting

### Structured Products for Private Clients

| Product | Description | FI Link |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Principal-protected note | Zero-coupon bond + call option on equity/index | Zeros provide principal protection |
| Yield enhancement note | Sell put option + bond, higher coupon if not called | Option premium boosts yield |
| Reverse convertible | High coupon but risk of receiving stock if below barrier | Credit + equity linked |
| Autocallable note | Calls automatically if underlying above trigger | Path-dependent structured coupon |
| Fixed-to-floating note | Fixed coupon period then floats | Rate view expression |

**Risks**: Issuer credit risk, limited liquidity, complexity/transparency, early call risk

### Private Banking Bond Advisory Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Investment policy statement (IPS) | Define bond allocation, duration range, credit quality limits |
| Liability-driven advice | Structure bond portfolio around client spending/liability needs |
| Credit research | Independent analysis of issuer credit quality |
| Trade execution | Access to primary and secondary bond markets |
| Portfolio reporting | Performance, risk analytics, tax lot reporting |

| Collateral management | Use bond portfolio as collateral for lending facilities |

### Bond Portfolio Lending (Securities-Based Lending)

**Mechanism**: Borrow against bond portfolio at preferential rates
- Loan-to-value varies by bond type: Treasuries 90-95%, munis 75-85%, corporates 60-80%, HY 50-60%
- Interest rate typically SOFR + spread
- No forced liquidation unless collateral falls below LTV threshold
- Used for: liquidity without selling bonds, bridge financing, avoiding tax events on sale

**Margin loan vs bond portfolio loan**:
| Feature | Margin Loan (Brokerage) | Bond Portfolio Loan (Private Bank) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Rate | Higher (broker call rate +) | Lower (SOFR + small spread) |
| LTV | Reg T: 50% for stocks, higher for bonds | Customized per bond type |
| Purpose | Trading | Liquidity, real estate, business |
| Recourse | Recourse | Can be non-recourse |

### Private Client Bond Portfolio Construction

**Step-by-step process**:
1. **Goals and constraints**: Income need, time horizon, tax situation, risk tolerance
2. **Asset allocation**: Determine FI % of total portfolio
3. **Benchmark selection**: Choose reference index (e.g., Bloomberg US Agg, custom benchmark)
4. **Duration positioning**: Align with rate view and liability horizon
5. **Sector allocation**: Treasuries, agencies, corporates, munis, securitized
6. **Credit quality**: Investment grade vs high yield allocation
7. **Security selection**: Direct bonds or funds, individual credit analysis
8. **Implementation**: Build position sizes, stagger purchases, manage liquidity
9. **Monitoring**: Rebalance, credit surveillance, tax-loss harvesting

### Key Considerations for Private Bankers

- **Concentrated positions**: Client may hold large single-stock or company bond position — need diversification
- **Legacy holdings**: Bonds inherited or held for decades with low cost basis
- **Business owner bonds**: Owner-issued debt or guaranteed obligations
- **Multi-jurisdiction**: Clients with residency in multiple countries face cross-border tax/reg issues
- **Art/collectibles as collateral**: Alternative asset-backed lending within bond portfolio context
- **Inheritance planning**: Step-up in cost basis for bonds held at death, bond gifts to family

## Common Misconception

"Bonds = safe, stocks = risky for all clients." For long horizon clients, stocks may be safer (inflation protection, growth). Bonds can be riskier in real terms when yields below inflation. Risk is situational — depends on goals, not asset class label.

## Key Takeaways

- Bond allocation varies by wealth tier: mass affluent use funds, UHNW use direct holdings
- Tax-efficient bond placement critical for private client returns
- Municipal bonds essential for high-tax-bracket clients
- Securities-based lending against bond portfolio provides cheap liquidity
- Structured products deliver customized risk/return but carry issuer and complexity risk
- Private bank bond advisory spans IPS, execution, credit research, reporting

## Feynman Explain

Explain why a high-net-worth client in a high-tax state (e.g., California, New York) would prefer in-state municipal bonds over Treasuries or corporate bonds. Walk through the tax-equivalent yield calculation and account location strategy.

## Reframe

Some advisors argue that ultra-high-net-worth clients should avoid bonds entirely for growth-oriented assets, claiming bond returns are too low to meaningfully impact portfolio outcomes for large wealth bases. Under what conditions does this argument break down? Consider spending needs, volatility management, and the client's definition of wealth preservation.
