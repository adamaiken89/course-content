## Core Content

### What is repo?

**Repurchase agreement**: sell security today with agreement to buy back at future date at higher price.

Economically: collateralized short-term loan.

```text
Day 1: Borrower sells bond → receives cash
Day T: Borrower repurchases bond → pays cash + interest
```

Interest = repo rate.

### Repo vs Reverse repo

| Party | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Borrower** (in repo) | Sells bond today, repurchases later. Receives cash. Pays repo rate |
| **Lender** (in reverse repo) | Buys bond today, sells later. Lends cash. Earns repo rate |

They are the same trade viewed from opposite sides.

### Mechanics

```text
Accrued interest adjusted:
Start: Cash = Bond price + accrued interest
End: Cash_back = Start_cash × (1 + repo_rate × days/360)
```

Collateral: Treasuries (most common), agencies, MBS, corporates.

### Haircut (initial margin)

```text
Haircut = (Collateral value - Cash lent) / Collateral value
```

Protects lender from collateral price decline.

Why different haircuts by asset? Higher volatility → larger potential price gap between margin calls → more protection needed. Treasury barely moves intraday; HY bond can gap 5% on earnings miss.

| Collateral | Typical Haircut |
|------------|-----------------|
| Treasury | 0.5-2% |
| Agency MBS | 2-5% |
| IG corporate | 5-10% |
| HY corporate | 10-20% |
| Equities | 10-50% |

Higher volatility → higher haircut.

### GC vs Special repo

| Type | Collateral | Rate | Notes |
|------|------------|------|-------|
| **General Collateral (GC)** | Any Treasury | Lowest | Interbank funding |
| **Special** | Specific security | Below GC | Short-seller needs specific bond |
| **Fails** | None | Highest | Failed delivery penalty |

Special rate can go negative (short squeeze).

### Market participants

| Participant | Role |
|-------------|------|
| Money market funds | Lend cash (reverse repo) |
| Hedge funds | Borrow cash to lever, borrow bonds to short |
| Primary dealers | Intermediaries |
| Central bank (Fed RRP) | Set floor on overnight rates |
| Pension/insurance | Lend bonds for extra yield |

### Uses of repo

1. **Leverage**: hedge fund posts $10M cash, borrows $90M in repo → controls $100M bond position
2. **Short selling**: borrow specific bond to sell short (reverse repo)
3. **Inventory funding**: dealers fund bond inventory via repo
4. **Cash management**: money funds earn return on excess cash

### Tri-party repo

Intermediary (BNY Mellon / JPMorgan) handles collateral valuation, margin calls, settlement.

Reduces operational burden. Dominant form of US repo.

### Repo market stress

2008: haircuts spiked → repo lenders withdrew → forced selling → crisis amplified.

2019: repo rates spiked to 10% (reserves shortage, quarter-end constraints).

How likely? Repo stress events are rare but systemic — ~1-2 major events per decade. SOFR spiked above 5% only 3 times in 2020-2025. Quarter-end spikes more common (~monthly pattern of 10-50bp).

Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR): benchmark replacing LIBOR.

Question: Repo is collateralized — why was it a problem in 2008? Answer: Collateral was MBS whose value crashed. Lenders demanded higher haircuts → forced selling → more price drops → higher haircuts. Liquidity spiral.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic repo calculation

Dealer repo $100M Treasuries for 7 days at 4.5%.

Start cash = $100M (ignoring accrued for simplicity)

End cash = $100M × (1 + 0.045 × 7/360) = $100M × 1.000875 = $100,087,500

Repo interest = $87,500

### Example 2: Haircut

Hedge fund buys $100M corporate bonds. Posts $10M equity, borrows $90M in repo.

Haircut = (100M - 90M) / 100M = 10%

If bond price falls to $95M → margin call (equity < haircut × new collateral value).

### Example 3: Private bank context

Client's fund uses repo to lever MBS portfolio.

Treasury repo rate = 4.25%. Fund earns 5.50% on MBS.

Net carry = 5.50% - 4.25% = 1.25% on borrowed amount.

Leverage magnifies return: $10M equity + $40M repo = $50M MBS → net return = [50×5.5% - 40×4.25%] / 10 = [2.75 - 1.70] / 10 = 10.5% equity return (vs 5.5% unlevered).

But leverage magnifies losses too.

## Common Misconception

"Repo is collateralized so no risk." Counterparty risk exists if collateral drops suddenly (2008 MBS). Also operational risk (2019 settlement fails). Haircut protects but isn't perfect.

> **Predict**: Before reading deeper: what do you expect happens when repo vs reverse interacts with mechanics in repo & reverse repo?
>
> *Answer: The system relies on repo vs reverse to keep mechanics predictable — when both apply, the stricter rule wins.*
> **Think**: How does **What is repo?** relate to **Repo vs Reverse repo** within repo & reverse repo?
>
> *Answer: They address adjacent failure modes: what is repo? governs the primary behavior, while repo vs reverse repo constrains how far you can push it.*
> **Cloze**: {blank} governs how repo & reverse repo behaves when multiple mechanics concerns collide.
> **Cloze**: The rule that keeps repo vs reverse correct under load is called {blank}.
> **Cloze**: In repo & reverse repo, haircut determines {blank}.
> **Spot the Mistake**: A developer treats repo vs reverse as optional because "it works without it." Where is the mistake?
>
> *Answer: It works only until the assumptions behind repo vs reverse are violated. The fix: treat it as part of the contract of repo & reverse repo, not an optimization.*


## Key Takeaways
- Repo = collateralized short-term loan. Reverse repo = lending cash
- Haircut protects lender. Higher volatility → higher haircut
- GC: general funding. Special: specific security demand
- Repo enables leverage, short selling, dealer inventory funding
- Tri-party repo dominates (third-party agent)
- SOFR replaced LIBOR as overnight reference rate
- Repo stress = systemic risk (2008, 2019)

## Feynman Explain
Explain repo to a colleague: "How does a hedge fund buy $100M of bonds with only $10M?" Use mortgage analogy (house down payment = haircut).

*Self-check: Can you explain why special repo rates can go below GC?*

## Reframe
Critique repo market: "Is repo market stable or fragile?" Consider 2008 freeze and 2019 spike. What reforms helped? (CCP clearing, higher haircuts, Fed RRP facility.) Write your answer.
