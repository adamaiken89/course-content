### What is CDS?

Credit Default Swap = insurance against default.

- **Protection buyer**: pays periodic premium (spread)
- **Protection seller**: makes payment if credit event occurs

Key difference from insurance: CDS can be bought without owning underlying bond ("naked CDS"). Insurance requires insurable interest.

Contract terms:
- **Reference entity**: company or sovereign
- **Notional**: amount protected
- **Maturity**: 1yr, 3yr, 5yr, 7yr, 10yr (5yr most liquid)
- **Coupon**: standard 100bp or 500bp
- **Upfront payment**: difference between standard coupon and market spread

### Credit events

ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) defines:

1. **Bankruptcy** (corporate)
2. **Failure to pay** (corporate + sovereign)
3. **Restructuring** (corporate)
4. **Obligation acceleration** (rare)
5. **Repudiation/Moratorium** (sovereign)

2009 "Big Bang" protocol: standardized auctions for settlement.

### CDS pricing

```text
CDS spread ≈ (1 - Recovery) × Probability of default
```

Example: Recovery = 40%, PD = 2% annually
CDS spread ≈ (1 - 0.40) × 2% = 1.2% = 120bp

Market CDS spread reflects market's view of credit risk.

Why standard coupons 100bp and 500bp? Standardization makes CDS tradeable like bonds. Instead of negotiating spread per trade, market quotes upfront payment to adjust — same efficiency as bond price vs coupon.

### Upfront payment

Standard coupons: 100bp (IG) or 500bp (HY).

If market spread > standard coupon → protection seller pays upfront (buyer pays less premium).

If market spread < standard coupon → protection buyer pays upfront.

Example: 5yr CDS at 180bp. Standard coupon = 100bp.
Buyer pays ≈ 80bp × duration as upfront.

### CDS indices

| Index | Region | Entities | Type |
|-------|--------|----------|------|
| **CDX.NA.IG** | North America | 125 | IG |
| **CDX.NA.HY** | North America | 100 | HY |
| **iTraxx Europe** | Europe | 125 | IG |
| **iTraxx Crossover** | Europe | 75 | HY |

Traded as single contract. Each series has fixed membership, rolls every 6 months.

### CDS basis

```text
Basis = CDS spread - Bond spread (over same reference rate)
```

| Basis | Meaning | Trade |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Positive** | CDS > bond spread | Sell CDS, buy bond (cheap funding) |
| **Negative** | CDS < bond spread | Buy CDS, short bond |
| **Zero** | Fair value | No arb |

Negative basis common in stressed markets (CDS cheap vs cash).

### Uses of CDS

1. **Hedging credit exposure** without selling bond
2. **Short credit** (buy protection) when bond hard to borrow
3. **Synthetic long credit** (sell protection) for yield
4. **Basis trading** (cash vs synthetic arb)
5. **Portfolio management** (adjust credit exposure efficiently)

### Sovereign CDS

Same mechanics but credit events include:
- Failure to pay
- Moratorium/Repudiation
- Restructuring

Sovereign CDS spreads: Greece >1000bp (2012), Germany ~10bp.

## Examples

### Example 1: CDS hedge

Bank holds $10M of BBB corporate bonds. Wants to hedge credit risk.

Buys $10M CDS protection at 150bp.

Annual cost = $10M × 1.5% = $150,000

If bond defaults: bank loses on bond, but CDS pays out (par - recovery).

Net position: hedged.

### Example 2: Negative basis trade

Bond yields 200bp over LIBOR. CDS = 150bp.

Basis = -50bp.

Buy bond (earn 200bp), buy CDS (pay 150bp). Net = 50bp risk-free + carry.

Trade works if basis converges to zero.

### Example 3: Private bank context

Client's portfolio concentrated in banking sector. Comfort with bank credit but wants to dial down sector weight temporarily.

Instead of selling bonds (tax, transaction cost): buy CDS protection on bank index for 6 months.

Synthetic hedge. Remove when comfortable.

## Common Misconception

"CDS = insurance, always pays out." Protection seller can fail (AIG 2008). Auction determines recovery — may be less than expected. Legal disputes over credit events common. Counterparty risk matters.

> **Predict**: Before reading deeper: what do you expect happens when credit events interacts with cds pricing in credit derivatives (cds)?
>
> *Answer: The system relies on credit events to keep cds pricing predictable — when both apply, the stricter rule wins.*
> **Think**: How does **What is CDS?** relate to **Credit events** within credit derivatives (cds)?
>
> *Answer: They address adjacent failure modes: what is cds? governs the primary behavior, while credit events constrains how far you can push it.*
> **Cloze**: {blank} governs how credit derivatives (cds) behaves when multiple cds pricing concerns collide.
> **Cloze**: The rule that keeps credit events correct under load is called {blank}.
> **Cloze**: In credit derivatives (cds), upfront payment determines {blank}.
> **Spot the Mistake**: A developer treats credit events as optional because "it works without it." Where is the mistake?
>
> *Answer: It works only until the assumptions behind credit events are violated. The fix: treat it as part of the contract of credit derivatives (cds), not an optimization.*


## Key Takeaways
- CDS = credit insurance. Protection buyer pays spread
- Standard coupons: 100bp (IG), 500bp (HY). Upfront payment for difference
- Credit events: bankruptcy, failure to pay, restructuring
- CDS spread ≈ (1-Recovery) × PD
- Indices: CDX (US), iTraxx (Europe)
- Basis = CDS spread - bond spread. Negative basis = cash cheap vs CDS
- CDS enables synthetic long/short credit exposure

## Feynman Explain
Explain CDS to a colleague: "How can you insure a bond against default?" Use car insurance analogy. Who pays premium, who receives payout.

*Self-check: Can you explain why CDS spread can differ from bond spread (basis) and what a negative basis means?*

## Reframe
Critique CDS market: "Are CDS speculators destabilizing?" Consider: AIG 2008, naked CDS (buying protection without owning bond), transparency reforms. Write your answer.
