## Core Content

### Major Regulatory Frameworks

| Regulation | Jurisdiction | Key Impact on FI Markets |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Dodd-Frank Act (2010) | US | Mandatory clearing, swap execution facilities (SEFs), trade reporting |
| MiFID II / MiFIR (2018) | EU | Pre/post-trade transparency, systematic internalisers, best execution |
| EMIR (2012) | EU | Derivatives clearing, risk mitigation, reporting to trade repositories |
| Basel III | Global | Bank capital/liquidity requirements, leverage ratio, NSFR/LCR |
| SEC Rule 2a-7 | US | Money market fund reform, floating NAV, liquidity fees/redemption gates |

### Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

**Title VII — Wall Street Transparency and Accountability**:
- **Clearing mandate**: Standardized OTC derivatives must clear through CCPs
- **Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs)**: Electronic platforms for swap trading
- **Trade reporting**: All swaps reported to swap data repositories (SDRs)
- **Margin requirements**: Non-cleared swaps subject to initial and variation margin
- **Real-time price transparency**: Pre/post-trade transparency for swaps

**Impact on FI markets**:
- CDS trading moved from voice to electronic (SEFs)
- Bilateral margin calls increased collateral demand
- Higher costs for bespoke/uncleared derivatives
- Reduced liquidity in some exotic products

### MiFID II / MiFIR

**Transparency requirements**:
| Bond Type | Pre-Trade | Post-Trade |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Government bonds | Firm quotes for specific sizes | Within 15 min (delayed for large) |
| Corporate bonds | Indicative quotes | Within 15 min |
| Structured products | Limited transparency | End of day |

**Key concepts**:
- **Systematic Internaliser (SI)**: Firm that deals on own account, organized, frequent, systematic — must provide firm quotes
- **Best execution**: Firms must take all sufficient steps to obtain best possible result
- **Double volume cap**: Limits on trading under waiver from pre-trade transparency
- **Bond liquidity assessments**: Periodic review of liquidity tiers for deferral eligibility

### EMIR (European Market Infrastructure Regulation)

- **Clearing obligation**: Standardized OTC derivatives cleared through CCPs
- **Reporting**: All derivatives reported to trade repositories
- **Risk mitigation**: Timely confirmation, portfolio reconciliation, dispute resolution
- **Bilateral margin**: Non-cleared derivatives subject to variation margin + initial margin
- **LEI requirement**: Legal Entity Identifier for all counterparties

### Basel III — Bank Capital and Liquidity

Why Basel III? Pre-2008 banks held too little capital vs risk. A $100B trading book needed only ~$1B capital. When markets crashed, losses exceeded capital → bailouts. Basel III raised capital requirements by 3-5x for trading books.

**Capital requirements for bond inventory**:
| Metric | Requirement | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Leverage Ratio (LR) | 3% Tier 1 / exposure | Limits balance sheet for bond inventory |
| Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) | HQLA ≥ 30-day net cash outflows | Bank demand for high-quality bonds |
| Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) | Available stable funding ≥ Required stable funding | Penalty for long-dated bond holdings with short-term funding |
| Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) | Enhanced leverage ratio for GSIBs | Constrains repo and securities lending |

**Consequences for FI markets**:
- Reduced dealer balance sheet capacity → higher bid-ask spreads
- LCR created structural demand for Treasuries (HQLA)
- NSFR disincentivizes long-dated bond financing with short-term repo
- Repo market affected by leverage ratio constraints (especially at quarter-end)

### SEC Money Market Fund Reform

**Rule 2a-7 changes (2014/2023)**:
- Prime institutional MMFs must have floating NAV (not constant $1)
- Liquidity fees (up to 2%) and redemption gates can be imposed
- Increased minimum liquidity requirements (30% weekly liquid assets)
- 2023 amendment: Swing pricing mandatory for prime institutional MMFs

**Impact**: Shift from prime MMFs to government MMFs, affecting repo and short-term credit markets

### Market Oversight Bodies

| Body | Jurisdiction | Role in FI Markets |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| SEC | US | Securities regulation, bond market structure, disclosure |
| FINRA | US | Self-regulatory, TRACE reporting, exam/enforcement |
| MSRB | US | Municipal securities rulemaking |
| CFTC | US | Derivatives (swaps, futures) oversight |
| ESMA | EU | Securities markets regulator, MiFID II enforcement |
| ECB | EU | Monetary policy, bond purchases (PEPP, PSPP) |
| BOE/FCA | UK | Prudential regulation / conduct authority |
| IOSCO | Global | International standards coordination |

### Basel Endgame (US Proposal, 2023)

**Proposed changes**:
- Higher risk weights for trading book (FRTB — Fundamental Review of the Trading Book)
- Increased operational risk capital
- Revised credit valuation adjustment (CVA) framework
- Binding leverage ratio constraint for largest banks

**Potential market impact**:
- Further reduced dealer bond inventory capacity
- Higher costs for securitization exposures
- Incentive for banks to exit certain FI businesses (commo, some structured products)

### Regulatory Reporting for Private Banks

**When advising clients on FI positions**:
- **FATCA**: Reporting US securities held by foreign clients
- **CRS (Common Reporting Standard)**: Automatic exchange of client account information
- **EMIR reporting**: Derivative transaction reporting obligation
- **MiFID II**: Client categorization (retail/professional/eligible counterparty), suitability, reporting
- **Dodd-Frank**: Swap dealer registration if crossing certain thresholds

### Private Bank Context

Regulatory compliance affects private banking bond operations:
- Client suitability assessment before bond recommendations
- Best execution obligations on fixed income trades
- Reporting of derivative positions (EMIR, Dodd-Frank)
- FATCA/CRS compliance for cross-border bond holdings
- Know-your-customer (KYC) documentation for bond account opening
- Capital charges on structured note inventory
- Liquidation of client US bond holdings must comply with US/EU cross-border rules (e.g., reverse solicitation)

## Common Misconception

"More regulation = safer markets." Regulation reduces systemic risk but creates unintended consequences. Basel III → less dealer inventory → wider bid-ask spreads → lower liquidity for clients in stress. Trade-off between stability and market function.

> **Predict**: Before reading deeper: what do you expect happens when major regulatory interacts with frameworks in regulatory environment?
>
> *Answer: The system relies on major regulatory to keep frameworks predictable — when both apply, the stricter rule wins.*
> **Think**: How does **Major Regulatory Frameworks** relate to **Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act** within regulatory environment?
>
> *Answer: They address adjacent failure modes: major regulatory frameworks governs the primary behavior, while dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act constrains how far you can push it.*
> **Cloze**: {blank} governs how regulatory environment behaves when multiple frameworks concerns collide.
> **Cloze**: The rule that keeps major regulatory correct under load is called {blank}.
> **Cloze**: In regulatory environment, dodd determines {blank}.
> **Spot the Mistake**: A developer treats major regulatory as optional because "it works without it." Where is the mistake?
>
> *Answer: It works only until the assumptions behind major regulatory are violated. The fix: treat it as part of the contract of regulatory environment, not an optimization.*


## Key Takeaways

- Dodd-Frank pushed OTC derivatives to central clearing and SEF trading
- MiFID II increased bond market transparency with pre/post-trade requirements
- Basel III constraints reduce dealer balance sheet capacity, affecting liquidity
- MMF reform shifted money market assets from prime to government funds
- Banks face increasing capital charges for bond inventory and derivatives
- Private banks must navigate cross-border reporting and suitability rules

## Feynman Explain

Explain how Basel III's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) created a structural increase in demand for government bonds. Why do banks hold more Treasuries now than before 2008? Trace the mechanism from regulation to market impact.

## Reframe

Regulatory costs reduce market liquidity, yet regulations exist because of market failures exposed by the 2008 crisis. Is the optimal regulatory regime the one that maximizes market liquidity, or the one that ensures financial stability even at a cost to liquidity? Consider the trade-off between dealer capacity and systemic risk reduction.
